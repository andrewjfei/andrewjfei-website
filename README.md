## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

Make sure you have `git` installed. For more information visit https://git-scm.com/ for more information.

Open up terminal on your local device. Navigate to a directory where you want the repository to be cloned to, by using the `cd` command. Run `git clone https://github.com/andrewjfei/andrewjfei-website.git` to clone this repository to your desired destination.

### Running Locally

Once you have cloned the repository, change directory into the cloned repository by running `cd andrewjfei-website`. Then run `ng serve` to start up a development server. Open up a browser and then navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`, the app should be loaded. 

**The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.**
