# Andrew J Fei

This is a project aimed towards creating a photography website.

The end goal for this project is to eventually be able to start up a freelancing photography business.

I have found a passion for photography over the years, and decided that it would be a good idea to start a buisness doing photography. Currently, studying software engineering it only made sense for me to try add create my own photography website from scratch rather than using third parties such as Wix, SquareSpace, etc.

This website was built using Angular version 9.0.
